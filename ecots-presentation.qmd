> Well designed games emphasize ***engagement, persistence, and resiliance*** in the face of setbacks. Games encourage players to ***act creatively, and collaboratively***, to learn new content and skills, and to develop expertise. [@gameful]

## Self-Determination Theory

:::{.small}
> Humans are naturally interested in learning and internalizing the knowledge, customs, and values surrounding them. [@niemiec2009]

:::{.incremental}
-   This learning occurs most naturally in environments which support the core psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness [@deci2012]. 

:::{.small}
  + Learners have the ability to make meaningful choices about their environment.
  + Learners feel skilled and that their skills are being developed by the presence of optimal challenges.
  + Learners feel connected to other people.

:::{.note}
When these psychological needs are met, learners experience greater intrinsic motivation, which can boost their creativity, attention, persistence, and satisfaction.

> In video games, players learn simple skills in low-stakes contexts that are then gradually strung together in increasingly complex sequences and scenarios.  [@gameful]
