> Well designed games emphasize ***engagement, persistence, and resilience*** in the face of setbacks. Games encourage players to ***act creatively, and collaboratively***, to learn new content and skills, and to develop expertise [@gameful]. 

## Self-Determination Theory

::: small
::: incremental
-   Learning occurs most naturally in environments which support the core psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness [@deci2012].
-   Specifically, environments where learners have the ability to:
    * make meaningful choices about their environment
    * feel skilled and that their skills are being developed by the presence of optimal challenges
    * feel connected to others

:::{.fragment}
::: small
> When these psychological needs are met, learners experience greater intrinsic motivation, which can boost their creativity, attention, persistence, and satisfaction [@deci2012].
